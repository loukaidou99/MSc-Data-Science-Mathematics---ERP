# Coding Folder

This folder contains all the R Markdown scripts used throughout the ERP report. The scripts are organized to reflect the different stages of the analysis:

#### **a) `requirements.md`**:
   - **Purpose**: How to install required libraries.

#### **b) `data_analysis_and_MLR_LLM.Rmd`**:
   - **Purpose**: This script performs data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and constructs the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Linear Mixed Model (LLM).
   - **Key Steps**:
     - **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
     - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Generating plots to visualize the data and understand underlying patterns.
     - **MLR Model Construction**: Building and evaluating the MLR model, followed by generating results and summary statistics.
     - **LLM Model Construction**: Building and evaluating the LLM model, followed by generating results and summary statistics.

#### **c) `data_analysis_and_STGAM.Rmd`**:
   - **Purpose**: This script also begins with data preprocessing for the Spatio-Temporal Generalized Additive Model (STGAM).
   - **Key Steps**:
     - **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
     - **Spatio-Temporal Analysis**: Conducting analysis specific to spatial and temporal patterns in the data.
     - **GAM Model Construction**: Building and evaluating the GAM model, followed by generating results and summary statistics.
     - **STGAM Model Construction**: Building and evaluating the STGAM model, followed by generating results and summary statistics.
